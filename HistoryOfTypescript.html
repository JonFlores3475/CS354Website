<h1>A Brief History of TypeScript</h1>

<body>
<p>
    TypeScript, developed by Microsoft, was released to the public, after a two-year internal development cycle, as a version 0.8. It was well received; however, there was still some criticism regarding the lack of support outside of Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
</p>
<p>
    1.0 was finally released at a Microsoft developer conference in 2014, and by July of that same year, a new, more efficient, dedicated compiler was released for the language.
</p>
<p>
    2.0 was released on September 22, 2016, and included several new key features including the ability to optionally enforce null safety (a protocol which guarantees that, within an object-oriented programming language, no objects will have a null or void value).
</p>
<p>
    3.0 was released on July 30th, 2018, and added a number of language features such as the introduction of the tuple data type.
</p>

<p>
    4.0 was released on August 20th, 2020 and added a few minor language features.
</p>

<p>
    5.0, the current version of TypeScript, was released on March 16th 2023, and included support for decorators.
</p>

<p>
    TypeScript was designed with the shortcomings of JavaScript in mind; thus making the languages similar, yet distinct. This also leads to a handy feature that allows the incorporation of some popular Javascript libraries.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the Typescript compiler, tsc, is written in TypeScript. This means, that as with all other typeScript, it can be compiled to JavaScript and be executed in any JavaScript engine.
